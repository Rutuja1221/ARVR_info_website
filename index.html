                technologies.</p>

                <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information 
                    such as images, videos, and 3D models onto the real world. It has 
                    applications in gaming, education, healthcare, and more.</p>
                <p>Imagine using an AR application for education. Students can point their 
                    smartphones or AR glasses at a textbook, and AR content, such as 3D 
                    models or additional explanations, appears on the screen. This makes 
                    learning more engaging and interactive.</p>

                <p>Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in a completely digital environment. 
                    It's widely used in gaming and simulations but also has applications in 
                    training, therapy, and entertainment.</p>
                <p>VR technology typically involves the use of specialized headsets or 
                    glasses that provide a 3D visual experience, often accompanied by spatial 
                    audio to create a fully immersive environment.</p>
                <p>Users can interact with and manipulate this digital world through gestures, 
                    controllers, or even full-body tracking systems. VR has the potential to 
                    revolutionize various industries, from gaming and entertainment to 
                    healthcare and education.</p>
